              Hi, my name is Jonathan Lammering. As a former senior-level
              Healthcare Administrator who has transitioned to Software
              Engineering, I am eager to apply my problem-solving abilities,
              analytical skills, and team-building expertise, along with my
              recent acquisition of knowledge in JavaScript (ES6), REACT, and
              Ruby on Rails, to make a an impact on the tech industry and
              further my growth as an engineer.
